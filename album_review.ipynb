        "# Album Review Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "I have been an avid music listener for years, fueled by my curiosity of musical history, love for different cultures, and awe of musical genius. Despite this, I was not keeping track of which genres, songs, albums, or artists I sought out. Since June 2025, I have decided to finally document my music listening journey in the form of album reviews on Google Slides. It has been incredibly fun and rewarding to listen to old favorites, relive nostalgic phases, and discover new albums. Even more so, it has been incredibly rewarding to share my passion project with friends and family. I have loved having conversations about what songs we put each other on and conversations of music in general. Please check out my [slide presentation (here)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-sit7RucDORoW2wk91QiWHLnOfyox87Op5ot0wf52d0/edit?usp=sharing) if you haven't already!\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this notebook is to manage, clean, visualize, and analyze the 'Album Review' Google Slides. As a passion project, this notebook will consistently be updated. I will be going step by step on how I do everything. If you ever get confused please let me know so I can rewrite clearer notes. I hope you find this as fun or interesting as much as I had fun writing it!"

This Google Sheet is then imported into this notebook, and is the source of data for this project."
